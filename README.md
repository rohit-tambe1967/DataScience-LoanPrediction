# DataScience-LoanPrediction
Assignment for on Loan Prediction

The assignment is to identify the factors important for predicting the loan approval and build a model for prediction.

There is train and test data in 2 CSV files - 'train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i' and 'test_Y3wMUE5_7gLdaTN'.
An excel file 'train_Data' is a working copy of the train data. It contains some filters aplied on the data. There are 
two more sheets in the workbook - 
  i) 'Graphs' contains some charts 
  ii) 'Reg.' contains regression analysis of the data

The 'LoanPredictionIII V 0.1.py' is the Python script that contains the script and logic applied on the data.
The script carried out some data clensing for different features/parameters. 
There are some comments, rasoning mentioned for each feature while applying a particular operation.
The TRAIN data is segregated further based on CoApplicant Income (<= 0 or >0) for some homogeneity. 

The regression analysis is carried out on all three datasets - Original TRAIN and (2) segregated datasets.
The observations of the analysis are noted in the 'Reg.' sheet in 'train_Data.xlsx'.

There is one 'scriptSummary.txt' file which contains connands/statements, extracted from the python script, that are 
executed to carry out the analysis.

PS - All the files may be updated anytime without prior notice. The Python script should not be used as it is as some commands
are not used anymore, but retained for reference.
